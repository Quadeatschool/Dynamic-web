      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        This website aims to be a central hub for students to discover
        discounts, deals, and free services available to them through their
        student status. It provides clear, step-by-step instructions on how to
        claim these benefits—ranging from software and subscriptions to local
        food and transportation deals.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The site is targeted at high school, college, and university students
        looking to save money and make the most of their student status. It's
        especially helpful for incoming freshmen and those on tight budgets who
        may not be aware of the variety of perks they can access.
      </p>

      <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
      <p>
        The site will use JavaScript to dynamically display benefit cards
        categorized by industry (Tech, Food, Subscriptions, etc.). Filters and
        search bars will allow students to find specific deals or types of
        benefits. Interactive elements like expandable details, progress steps
        to claim perks, and student verification status badges will enhance
        usability. All cards will be generated from JavaScript classes for easy
        scalability.
      </p>

      <h2>Style Guide</h2>

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL:
      <a
        href="https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c"

        >https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c</a
      >

      <table class="colors">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>Primary</th>
            <th>Secondary</th>
            <th>Accent 1</th>
            <th>Accent 2</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="primary">#A29F15</td>
            <td class="secondary">#F3B61F</td>
            <td class="accent1">#BBD8B3</td>
            <td class="accent2">#510D0A</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>Heading Font: Anton</h4>
      <h4>Paragraph Font: Open Sans</h4>
      <p>
        Anton was chosen for headings to give a bold, confident feel suitable
        for calling attention to benefit categories and company names. Open Sans
        is used for body text due to its readability and clean appearance,
        making instruction steps and descriptions easy to follow.
      </p>

      <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
      <p>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
        tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
        veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
        commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate
        velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint
        occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt
        mollit anim id est laborum.
      </p>
      <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
      <p class="colored">
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
        tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
        veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
        commodo consequat.
      </p>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 10------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Navigation</h3>
      <!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
      <nav>
        <a href="#">Home</a>
        <a href="#">Page2</a>
        <a href="#">Page3</a>
      </nav>

      <h2>Content</h2>

<h3>Home page</h3>
<p>
  The home page will introduce the Student Perk Archive and explain how the platform works. It will feature a search bar and category filter (e.g., Software, Food, Tech, Fitness, etc.). Featured perks will appear as interactive cards with company logos, discount details, and “how to claim” instructions. A short tutorial or checklist may guide new users through the claiming process.
</p>

<h3>Page 2 – Submit a Perk</h3>
<p>
  Page 2 will contain a form where users can suggest new perks or benefits they know about. The form will collect the deal name, link, company, description, and optionally an image. This helps crowdsource new discounts and expand the archive over time. It may also include a short FAQ about student eligibility and verification methods.
</p>

        Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
        here

      <h3>Home</h3>
